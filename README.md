![Hello!](https://c.tenor.com/xLkmU4JRI7oAAAAC/wave-snorlax.gif)
## Hi there! I'm Chris, a computer science major at the University of California Irvine.
### About me
I love coding, problem solving, and all aspects of computer science. I'm curious about the different niches of software engineering, and am currently interested in web development. I enjoy experimenting and playing around with new technologies. My goal is to learn as much as possible, and expand my knowledge in the field. Outside of programming, I enjoy watching anime, NBA, and action-comedy movies. I also play tennis, and *occasionally* valorant.
